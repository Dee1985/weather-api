Credits & Contributing
Outline of this ReadMe made available by my peer Jake O'Toole. Also, shoutout to my tutor and of course my TA's.

Challenges
I continue to struggle with JS scope and creating loops. There needs to be a clear method to prevent all searched cities to be added to display containers. Although this was added to prevent duplication in the search history. I really just ran out of time and need to consider what are priority objectives and what aren't.
